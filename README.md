<img src="app/img/app_screenshot_v_0-1-4_1.png" alt="OpenWeather App"/>

"OpenWeather App" is a small AngularJS project that makes use of the [OpenWeatherMap](http://openweathermap.org/)
service for fetching and displaying weather data and forecasts based on a given location (city).


## Why?

Points of interests:

* Building an app with AngularJS (of course!)
* Building an app based on the [OpenWeatherMap API](http://openweathermap.org/API/)
* Bootstrapping an AngularJS app: Basic modules and view definition, ng-app, ng-view
* Defining a controller for handling the weather data in $scope
* Defining a service for fetching weather data from openweathermap.com via JSONP
* Defining a custom directive for instantly embedding sort of "weather data day panel"
* Setting up unit and e2e-tests with karma/jasmine
* Building a graph with D3

angular-openweather-app uses:

* [AngularJS v1.2.0-rc.2](https://github.com/angular/angular.js) / [angular-seed](https://github.com/angular/angular-seed)
* [iso-3166-country-codes-angular](https://github.com/BluePyth/iso-3166-country-codes-angular)
* [Bootstrap v3.0.0](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap)
* [D3.js] (http://d3js.org/)
